# wsindex v1.0.0

> Web Site Index tool, a static site generator for list of web sites.

wsindex is a static site generator which creates the index web page of the list of web pages.

# Why is this necessary?

If one uses many many static site generators in a project and invokes them simultaneously, then it's a mess to open all of them. This tool works as the index of all the pages and works as the portal of your many many generated static sites.
